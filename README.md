Predicting if the patient has Kyphosis disease or not with the help of Machine Learning.
Models used - Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing 
a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes or mean/average prediction of the individual trees.

Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree to go 
from observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value.
